# vue-guides - course COMPLETED by David Katz

THis is a course on Udemy https://www.udemy.com/course/vue-web-apps/
The original repo was forked from https://github.com/15Dkatz/vue-guides 

This is NOT the official code- this is the code edited to make it work. 

Changes: 
- Joke App - his API on amazon is NOT up and running - you have to use a different API and NOT swapi

 Turnout app - it uses firebase v9 and whats in the course is v8. Not sure why he can't make a link or reference or add slides with the updated code. It took me foreer to know whats going on - but after much fighting and finally realizing v8 vs. v9 of firebase - I got it all working. 

See my code vs. his code using Git DIFF's or just download my repo to see the differences in those last 2 apps.

i hope it saves someone hours. Good course other than that.

Other than that this is basically the official vue-tutorial and code created during recording sessions. This course contains all the completed projects:

- Notemaster
- Starbase
- Starbase-Router
- Jokester
- Turnout
